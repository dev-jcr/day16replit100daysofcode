### ðŸ‘‰Let's try it out. 
What do you think the below code does? 

Remember you can use the big Stop button on the top if your program does not end.

```python
while True:
  print("This program is running")
print("Aww, I was having a good time ðŸ˜­")
```

This type of loop only has two conditions: `True` and `False`. *Make note of the capital "T" and "F".*

A Boolean Loop has two values: True or False. Impress your friends and tell them you know how to use a Boolean Loop.

In this loop, I am saying to the computer:

"while True is True...do this over and over again."


### Yes, we made an infinite loop, but hold on...
